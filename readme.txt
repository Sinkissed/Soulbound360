Setup

1 Install the addon into your Interface/AddOns directory as usual.

2 Download http://glovepie.org/GlovePIEWithoutEmotiv043.zip GLOVEPIE and open the S360.PIE file inside of the Interface/AddOns/Soulbound360 directory.

3 Click RUN in GLOVEPIE and start World of Warcraft

GLOVEPIE is Windows only. The addon and the instructions sent to GLOVEPIE are all completely visible inside of the Interface/Addons folder. This is in compliance with Blizzard's AddOn policy. Controls have 1-to-1 functionality, THERE ARE NO SCRIPTED OR AUTOMATED CONTROLS.


Play


Push the left joystick to move.

Push the right joystick for the cursor/to turn.

XYAB,Back,Start,Dpad dirctions and pressing in the joysticks are actions 1-12.

Shoulder Buttons are mouse click, target, action bars, and a modifier. Switching actionbars is required for accessing all abilities.

Bottom left shoulder modifies all the other buttons
-Pressing halfway gives you pet controls on 1-12 and left click.
-Pressing all the way gives you party targeting, aura/stance/shapeshift, and menus.
-Pressing both right or left shoulders lets you jump or autorun.

There are many more controls and combinations handed by the gamepad. Some controls can also be altered in the PIE file. A full diagram is displayed in game and can be toggled inside of the Interface/Addons menu. Have fun!
